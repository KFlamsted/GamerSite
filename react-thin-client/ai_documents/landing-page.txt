Landing page description
- Background video running
- Big title in the top center: White with a small black border and a black dense dropshadow
- A little scroll down notification at the buttom jumping up and down.

Here's how I want you to build it
- Remove all the unused stuff from the create-react-app scaffolding
- The background video should be a BackgroundVideoComponent stored within in a src/landingPage folder
- BackgroundVideoComponent.tsx
- BackgroundVideoComponent.css for the css.
- width: 100%, height: 100%, z-index: -1, a small dark filter (0.35) put on top, etc
- LandingPage.tsx using the background component and adding the title
- Title should be a h1 - font should be Bebas Neue. White, bold, small dark border and dense dropshadow
- Create the scroll down notification however you like however: create a component folder and put it in there for later reusage.
- Add this component to the LandingPage.tsx
- Use this LandingPage.tsx in the App.
