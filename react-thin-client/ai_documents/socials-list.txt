Content page is the initial page you see when you scroll down.
This content page will contain two things.
- Title and description
- List of socials and link to this

This is a high level description, followed by the file/folder structure of this feature.

#Title:
Similar to title on the main page. Color is white with black drop shadow
Top centered

#Description:
Description is in a box
Background color of that box is #0077FF
Box has rounded edges and a drop shadow.
Text color is white

#Socials list:
The socials list clickable rectangle boxes
The box is a link taking the user to that socials site
Box should be from left to right:
    - Socials logo
    - The user handle
    - Different background color
    - Potentially a thumbnail
Initially socials available:
    - Youtube (Red background)
    - Bluesky (Blue #0F73FF background)
    - Twitch (Purple background)
    - Twitter / X (Black background)
    - Instagram (Yellow background)
Text color is always white
There should be a socials component that all the other social components inherit base from
What social it is can be determined in a enum (or something similar)

Description box width should match these socials list boxes

#Load animation:
All boxes has a small "fade in up" loading animation or whatever the standard load for boxes is called

#File/folder structure:
In the components folder create a SocialsList folder.
This folder contains the base SocialComponent.tsx, each socials site specific component (YoutubeSocialsComponent.tsx) and a SocialList.tsx file that contains all the wished components
In the existing ContentSection folder we create a DescriptionComponent.tsx
In the ContextSection.tsx we add the Title, the DescriptionComponent and the SocialsList
